AI-Powered Smart Bird Detection & Repellent System using Raspberry Pi & IoT

This project is an innovative IoT-based solution designed to protect crops from birds using AI and smart automation. The system detects birds using a YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection model and triggers multiple actions like:

Sound Deterrents
Servo Motor Movements
Telegram Alerts to Farmers
Powered by Solar Energy, this Motorized Smart Scarecrow provides an intelligent, eco-friendly, and cost-effective solution for modern agriculture.
